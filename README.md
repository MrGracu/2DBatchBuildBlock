# 2DBatchBuildBlock
 [Batch] 2DBatchBuildBlock - simple command line game.  
 
  This is batch script where you can create a simple image using fourteen different characters.
  The program does not allow you to save the created image to a file, but you can do it, for example, using a screenshot (print screen key).  
  
  If there is a problem with the display of characters (they do not look like the pictures), it may be enough to change the font in the command line settings to "**Raster Fonts**".
  
## Works on systems
- Windows 7 or later.
